# Status Bar Title

Status Bar Title extension just shows the root name of the workspace on your status bar.
This extension might be useful when you hide the title bar by using [Customize UI](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iocave.customize-ui) and open multiple windows.

In development mode (window title has `[Extension Development Host]` prefix), the icon will be changed.
